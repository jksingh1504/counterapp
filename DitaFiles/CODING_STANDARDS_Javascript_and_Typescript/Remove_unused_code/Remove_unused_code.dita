   <title>Remove unused code</title>
   <body>
      <p outputclass="Para">It is extremely valuable to know if a piece of code is being used or not. If you let unused code stay, then in the future, it can be hard or almost impossible to be certain if itâ€™s actually used or not. Therefore, you should make it a high priority to remove unused code.</p>
