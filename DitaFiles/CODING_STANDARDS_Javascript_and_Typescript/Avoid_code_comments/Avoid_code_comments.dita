   <title>Avoid code comments</title>
   <body>
      <p outputclass="Para">Although there are cases for comments, you should really try to avoid them. You donâ€™t want your comments to compensate for your failure to express the message in your code. Comments should be updated as code is updated, but a better use of time would be to write code that explains itself. Inaccurate comments are worse than no comments at all.</p>
